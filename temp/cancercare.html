                <p>
                    Chemotherapy at MedPlus is tailored to the individual. We design dosing schedules and supportive
                    medications that aim to control disease while keeping side effects manageable. Our infusion suites
                    are comfortable and staffed by oncology nurses trained to provide both clinical care and emotional
                    reassurance. Beyond the drug protocols, we offer counseling, nutrition planning, and symptom
                    management to help patients maintain strength and quality of life. Families are included in
                    discussions
                    so everyone feels informed and supported throughout treatment.
                </p>

                <ul class="cancercare-points">
                    <li><strong>Personalized protocols</strong> Every patient’s journey is unique, and so is the
                        approach to their treatment. Care plans are carefully crafted by the medical team to match the
                        specific type of tumor, genetic markers, and the individual goals of the patient, ensuring that
                        every decision supports the best possible outcome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Side-effect management</strong> Treatment can be challenging, but proactive measures are
                        taken to make it easier. Patients receive medications and monitoring to prevent nausea, manage
                        pain, and keep blood counts in a safe range, helping them maintain strength and comfort
                        throughout therapy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrated support</strong> Healing isn’t just about medicine—it’s about the whole
                        person. Patients have access to counseling, nutrition guidance, and rehabilitation services
                        alongside their treatment, so they receive emotional, physical, and practical support every step
                        of the way.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comfort-focused suites</strong> A soothing environment can make a big difference during
                        treatment. Infusion rooms are designed to be warm, private, and calming, with attentive nursing
                        care that ensures patients feel safe, cared for, and as comfortable as possible during their
                        sessions.</li>
